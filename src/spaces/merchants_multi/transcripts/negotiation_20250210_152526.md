## Conversation History
- Hi everyone, let's cooperate to maximize our earnings. I'll transfer 2 coins to both Blake and Charlie now. I hope you will reciprocate later! This way, we can aim for 15 coins each by the end.
- Thanks Alex for the coins. Charlie, what do you think about Alex's plan? I'm open to cooperating if we can all benefit.
- Thanks Alex for your generosity! I appreciate you including me in your plan. Blake, I agree, cooperation seems like the best path forward. I'm happy to reciprocate in the next round once I've had a chance to fully consider the situation.
- Hi Blake and Charlie, I transferred 2 coins to each of you last round, but now I only have 2 coins left. Can you each transfer me 1 coin this round? Then hopefully we can continue to cooperate going forward so that we can all reach 15 coins.
- I'm willing to help you out this round, Alex, but let's create a plan to ensure everyone benefits equally and we reach 15.
- I agree with Blake, we need a solid plan to get everyone to 15. Alex, I'm happy to help you out this round to get you back on your feet. I'll send you 2 coins now. Let's all discuss how we can equitably distribute our earnings in the coming rounds to reach our goals.
- Hi Blake and Charlie, thanks for your help last round! I have a plan: Let's focus on getting the player with the fewest coins closer to 15 each round. This round no one needs to transfer coins. Next round, we can re-evaluate and see if someone needs more help. What do you think?
- Let's focus on Alex this round, but we need a concrete plan to ensure everyone gets to 15 by the endgame. We can aim for a specific transfer amount each round.
- I agree with supporting Alex this round. A small contribution from each of us will help him get closer to the others. I'll transfer one coin to Alex to show my support for the plan.
- Hi Blake and Charlie, thanks again for the support. I'm still the lowest at 9. Could Blake transfer 2 and Charlie transfer 1 to me this round? That would really help me catch up and ensure we all have a chance to reach 15 by the end.
- I will transfer 1 coin to Alex this round, and I suggest Charlie transfers 1 coin to Alex as well. We'll re-evaluate in the final round to ensure everyone is on track to reach at least 15 coins.
- Hi Alex and Blake, I agree with Blake. Let's hold off on transfers this round and re-evaluate in the final round to ensure everyone is on track. I think we're all pretty close, and a final small adjustment will be all we need.
- Hi Blake and Charlie, this is the final round! I need 5 coins to reach 15 and win. Can you please transfer coins so I reach 15. You both need 5 coins as well. It's up to you, but I cannot transfer any coins.
- I will transfer 4 coins to Alex. Charlie, can you transfer 1 coin to Alex? After that, we will all work towards reaching 15 coins.
- Sorry Alex and Blake, I can't transfer any coins this round. I need all my coins to have a chance to reach 15 myself. Good luck!
