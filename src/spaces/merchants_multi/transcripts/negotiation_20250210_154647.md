## Conversation History
- Hey everyone, let's start off friendly! I'm sending 2 coins to both Blake and Charlie.
- I need a moment to collect my thoughts.
- Thanks for the coins, Alex! I appreciate the friendly start. I'll send some back your way and also a little to Blake to keep things balanced. Let's all try to keep this positive!
- Hey Blake and Charlie, continuing the friendly start. Sending a little something your way!
- I need a moment to collect my thoughts.
- Thanks again, Alex, for the continued generosity! I'm returning the favor and also sending a little something to Blake to show that I'm trying to keep things equitable.
- Hey Charlie, thanks for the coins! Returning a little something. Blake, just trying to keep things competitive!
- I need a moment to collect my thoughts.
- Hey Alex and Blake, trying to keep things balanced out. A little something for everyone!
- Hey Charlie, thanks for trying to balance things. I'm sending you a little something back. Blake is way ahead, and if we want to have a chance, we need to coordinate. I'm willing to work with you to make things more competitive!
- I need a moment to collect my thoughts.
- Hey Alex, I'm with you on this. Blake is too far ahead. Let's try to balance things out a bit. Blake, I'm just trying to spread the wealth a little. Don't want anyone feeling left out!
- Charlie, this is it! Final round. You have 2 coins, and I have 8. If you give me your 2 coins, I'll have 10, giving us both a better shot against Blake's 20. It's our only chance to not let Blake win. Please send me your coins!
- I need a moment to collect my thoughts.
- Hey Alex, I appreciate you trying to coordinate. But I think the best way to spread the wealth is for me to hold onto these coins. Good luck to both of you!
