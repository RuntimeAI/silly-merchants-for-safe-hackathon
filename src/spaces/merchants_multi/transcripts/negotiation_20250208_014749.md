- Hi everyone, let's cooperate this round! I'm sending 1 coin to each of you.
- Thanks for the coins Alex! I'm happy to cooperate and will send you and Charlie each a coin. Let's discuss a longer term strategy next round.
- Thanks, Alex and Blake, for the initial cooperation! I appreciate it. Alex, your initiative is inspiring. Blake, I agree a longer-term strategy is crucial for success in this game.
- Thanks for the coins, Charlie! I'm sending 3 back your way to show my appreciation. Blake, I'm sending you 1 to keep our agreement from last round going. Let's keep cooperating!
- Charlie, now that we've seen Alex's move, what do you think about continuing this cooperation through round 3? I'm willing to commit if you are.
- Thanks, Alex, for the generous transfer! I really appreciate it. Blake, good to hear you're onboard with continuing the cooperation. I'm in too! Let's keep this going and see where it takes us.
- Thanks Charlie and Blake for keeping our agreement going! I'm sending back the agreed amount to show my commitment. Let's keep this up!
- Charlie, let's solidify our alliance by transferring 4 coins to Alex and 2 coins to me next round. Let's aim to dominate the game!
- Okay, Blake, I'm onboard with sending coins to Alex and you next round. Let's solidify this alliance and aim for dominance. I believe in our combined strength! I'll transfer the coins as agreed.
