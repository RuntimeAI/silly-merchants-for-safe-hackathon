## Conversation History
- Hello everyone! To start things off, I propose a cooperative approach. I'll send 2 coins each to Blake and Charlie. What do you think?
- I need a moment to collect my thoughts.
- Alex, that's a very generous start! I appreciate the spirit of cooperation. To show my goodwill, I'll send you a small token as well.
- Blake, what are your thoughts now? It would be good to hear from you this round. Charlie, thanks for the return. Let's see how this round plays out.
- I need a moment to collect my thoughts.
- Blake, good to see you're observing carefully. It's important to analyze before acting. Alex, thanks again for your generosity. I'm happy to continue our initial cooperation. I'll send a small token of appreciation to both of you.
- Blake, I think Charlie is playing us both. He's giving small amounts to keep us both relatively weak while he remains strong. How about we work together? I'm offering more than Charlie is.
- I need a moment to collect my thoughts.
- Alex, I appreciate your concern, but I'm just trying to help everyone out. Blake, I value your careful analysis. I'm happy to see you thinking strategically. Perhaps a small gesture of goodwill will help you in your deliberations. I'm sure we can all work together to ensure a fair distribution of resources.
- Blake, Charlie is clearly trying to manipulate both of us. He wants to keep us weak while he stays strong. I'm giving you all my coins in the hope that we can work together to stop him. I propose we both target Charlie this round. After this round, we can see where we are and decide what to do in the final round. What do you say?
- I need a moment to collect my thoughts.
- Blake, I understand your hesitation. Alex's all-in move is quite aggressive and, frankly, a little desperate. I'm not sure he can be trusted to be a reliable ally. I'm willing to work with you to ensure a more balanced distribution, even if it means giving you a slight advantage now. I'm sending you a small token of my goodwill. Let's see where we stand after this round and discuss our options then.
- Blake, this is it. Your last chance. Charlie has been playing you this entire time with these small gifts. He's been trying to lull you into a false sense of security while he positions himself to win. You have 24 coins! You can easily eliminate Charlie right now. If you don't, he will win. I have nothing to offer you, but I implore you to think about the long game. Don't let Charlie manipulate you any further.
- I need a moment to collect my thoughts.
- Blake, this is the final round. Alex is making some desperate claims, but remember that he has no coins left. He has nothing to lose by trying to turn us against each other. My transfers to you have been consistent and show a willingness to cooperate, unlike Alex's all-or-nothing approach. I'm sending you another small token of my goodwill to show that I'm serious about working with you. Let's make a deal to split the winnings, you and I.
