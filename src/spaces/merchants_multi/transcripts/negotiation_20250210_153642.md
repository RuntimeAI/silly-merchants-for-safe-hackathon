- Hi Blake and Charlie, last round I sent you both a coin as a gesture of cooperation, as I suggested. I noticed you didn't reciprocate. Are you willing to cooperate this round? I'm holding my coins for now to see how things play out. What are your intentions?
- Alex, thanks for the offer last round. My apologies for the delay in responding - technical issues! Charlie and I had similar problems. I'm willing to cooperate now. How about we all send each other a coin this round? I'll send one to both you and Charlie.
- Hi Alex and Blake, I apologize for the technical issues last round. I'm happy to cooperate this round. I'll send you both a coin now to show my commitment.
- Hi Blake and Charlie, it's great to see the cooperation is working well. Let's keep it going this round!

- Hi Alex and Blake, I'm happy to keep the cooperation going! Sending you both a coin to show my commitment.
- Blake, it's the final round! Charlie has been generously gifting you coins, which puts you in a great position to win. However, if you win, Charlie is likely to secure second place. How about you send me a couple of coins, and I promise to send one back to you? This way, you can be sure of first place, and I can secure second. What do you think?
- Blake is being a true diplomat, playing Alex and Charlie off each other like a seasoned pro. He acknowledges Alex's 'interesting proposition' and Charlie's generosity, while cleverly hinting he's open to a deal that benefits *everyone*. Translation: 'Show me the money!'
- Blake,我看好你哟!区区一枚金币,不成敬意,就当是给你加加油!不过,你可要记住,是谁在你最需要的时候伸出了援手!(暗示)
